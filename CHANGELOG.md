## Version 1.5.86

### New

- Added the support of SocketCam custom sized view on Android and iOS that the developer can import from `react-native-capture`.
- Added the `SocketCamViewContainer` component that the developer can import from `react-native-capture`.
  - `SocketCamViewContainer` handles much of the SocketCam logic, like starting the SocketCam extension on Android, checking whether or not SocketCam is enabled, and setting the trigger type based on a provided value.
- Added the first iteration of `CaptureHelper` that the developer can import from `react-native-capture`.
  - `CaptureHelper` contains useful functions related to SocketCam for the developer to use so they no longer have to build them from scratch.
- For Android: added a template for providing your own custom view, which includes a layout file to serve as the layout container for `SocketCamFragment`, as well as other Kotlin files specific to the custom view's package, view manager, custom view itself and the associated custom view activity. You can read more about custom views [here](https://docs.socketmobile.com/react-native-capture/en/latest/socketCamCustom.html).
- Updated documentation to include information related to `SocketCamViewContainer`, how to implement custom views for Android and iOS, `CaptureHelper`, and how to enable/disable a symbology.

### Improvements

- Removed any reference of/need for `NativeModules`, `DeviceEventEmitter`, getting whether or not SocketCam is enabled, or setting the SocketCam trigger from the example app.
  - Introduction of the`SocketCamViewContainer` component means the previous Native Module logic is now handled exclusively in the React Native CaptureSDK.

- Removed old Java files pertaining to obsolete native modules on the Android side (`CaptureModule.java`, `CapturePackage.java`, `CaptureService.java`).

- Changed `metro.config.js` to use latest syntax (including using `@react-native/metro-config`) in `example`.
- Simplified name of Native Modules from `NativeCaptureModule` to `Capturesdk`.
