# React Native CaptureSDK

The repository has been relocated within the Socket Mobile [Developer Portal](https://www.socketmobile.com/developers/portal) to enhance camera scanning capabilities with the SocketCam C860.

It employs a high-performance decoder capable of swiftly reading damaged barcodes in various lighting conditions.

The new SocketCam C860 is provided to developers at no cost and requires no additional coding efforts if the application includes a UI trigger button.

Activation of the C860 is left to the application's end user, who can enable its use by purchasing a subscription.

It's important to note that the free version of our camera-based scanner, the SocketCam C820, remains accessible.

Both the C860 and C820 utilize the same APIs as our physical scanner products, ensuring a seamless transition between a camera-based scanner and a physical barcode scanner.

More documentation can be found [here](https://docs.socketmobile.com/react-native-capture/en/latest/ "CaptureSDK Documentation").

For more information and how to access, please visit our page [about this new product](https://www.socketmobile.com/readers-accessories/product-families/socketcam).

On 1st of July 2024, there won't be any support for this repository and we will focus on the React Native CaptureSDK hosted through our [DEVELOPERS PORTAL](https://www.socketmobile.com/dev-portal/portal).
